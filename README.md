## Overview

Phishing is one of the most common forms of cyberattacks. This project aims to develop a reliable tool that analyzes various characteristics of URLs or websites and predicts whether they are legitimate or phishing attempts using a trained machine learning model.

---

## Features

- Input URL and classify it as **Legitimate** or **Phishing**
- Real-time analysis using a trained model
- Web interface for easy access
- Uses URL-based feature extraction for classification

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React/Bootstrap if applicable)
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django)
- **Model:** Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or similar)
- **Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn, joblib, Flask
- **Deployment (optional):** Render, Heroku, or Localhost

---

## How It Works

1. User inputs a URL in the web form.
2. URL is preprocessed and relevant features are extracted.
3. These features are passed to a trained ML model.
4. The model outputs a prediction: "Phishing" or "Legitimate".
5. The result is displayed on the web interface.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-detection-web.git
   cd phishing-detection-web
Create virtual environment & install dependencies
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the app
python app.py
Usage

Navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your browser.
Enter a URL in the input box.
Click on "Check URL".
See the result displayed instantly.
Model Explanation

The model is trained using a dataset with labeled URLs (phishing/legit).
Features include:
URL length
Use of @, -, or https
Presence of IP address in URL
Subdomain depth
Number of redirections
and more...
Trained using [Logistic Regression / Random Forest / etc.] with accuracy of XX%.
Limitations

False positives/negatives may occur.
Model depends on dataset quality and feature engineering.
Does not scan the full webpage — only the URL structure.
Future Enhancements

Add content-based phishing detection (scan webpage elements).
Integrate with browser extension for real-time protection.
Add URL blacklist/whitelist checking.
Deploy to the cloud with user authentication and reporting dashboard.
